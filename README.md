# FastAPI Review
An app to add, update and delete a user in a database.


#### Overview
FastAPI is a super fast Python framework that allows developers to build APIs. To serve the API it uses Uvicorn which is a fast ASGI-server. While working on this repo, I was able to learn about ways to interact with the API using SwaggerUI which is built within the FastAPI framework.

The API is focused around building a database of users who are admins and students. I was able to use HTTP Request to "GET","POST", "PUT", "DELETE" to interact with the database as well.
